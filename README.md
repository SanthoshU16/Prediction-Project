# 📘 Predicting the Future of Professors in an AI-Driven Education System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes how **students and teachers perceive the future role of professors in an AI-driven education system**. Using survey data, machine learning, and interactive dashboards, the study explores whether AI can replace, partially assist, or only support human professors.

The project combines **data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling** to draw meaningful insights about the role of AI in modern education.
